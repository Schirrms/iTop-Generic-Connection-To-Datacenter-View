# iTop-Generic-Connection-To-Datacenter-View
Just a very small extension to complete Generic-Connection with Molkobain's Datacenter View

# Goal

This is a tiny extension, just adding some fields of Molkobain's [DatacenterView extension](https://github.com/Molkobain/itop-datacenter-view) in my own [iTop-Generic-Connection extension](https://github.com/Schirrms/iTop-Generic-Connection).

# Versions

- 2019-xx-xx : v0.1 just some hooks to links some of my classes with the great work of Molkobain :)
- 2020-09-25 : v0.2 Molkobain did an uncredible work to add specific colors in the 'Rack View' for my own extension ! Thanks Molkobain !

# Dependencies

Of course, this extension can only be installed on a system with :

- Molkobain's DatacenterView >= 1.7.0
- iTop-Generic-Connection >= 0.7.2

# 2022-03-18 update : this contribution didn't work anymore with Molkobain's DatacenterView 1.10.0. So the version 0.3.0+ are not backward compatible with Molkobain's DatacenterView <= 1.8.0 (Didn't test version 1.9).

# Installation

As for all my extensions, just download the zip file, and copy the 'schirrms-...' directory in your extensions directory, then rerun the setup as usual.
